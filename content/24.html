<h1> Practical Engineering blog on microservices </h1><br />
<br />
Microservices have become an increasingly popular way to build applications, and for good reason. They provide a way to build distributed systems that are easier to maintain, scale, and deploy, and ultimately reduce the cost of software development.<br />
<br />
But as with any new technology, there are a few issues that can arise when using microservices. From figuring out how to best structure the architecture, to understanding the different tools and libraries available, it can be difficult to know where to start.<br />
<br />
That’s why we’ve put together this blog to help you get up to speed quickly. Here, we’ll cover the latest trends in microservices, suggest practical solutions to common problems, and provide useful APIs, libraries, and tools that are open source and cost-effective.<br />
<br />
One of the most important aspects of microservices is how they are structured. You need to have a clear understanding of how the system should be built, and how the individual services should communicate with each other. This can be a complex task, but luckily there are some great tools out there to help. Kubernetes is one of the most popular orchestration tools, and it provides a powerful way to manage and deploy your services.<br />
<br />
In addition to architecture, it’s important to understand the different tools and libraries available to you. There are many open source solutions for microservices that you can use, from libraries like Spring Boot, to messaging and streaming tools like Apache Kafka. It’s important to understand the different options available to you and choose the right tool for the job.<br />
<br />
Finally, it’s important to consider the cost of developing and deploying microservices. There are several open source solutions that are cost-effective, such as AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions. These services provide a cost-effective way to deploy and manage your microservices, and are great for businesses on a budget.<br />
